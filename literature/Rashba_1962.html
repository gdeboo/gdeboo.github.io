<h1>Edge absorption theory in semiconductors</h1>
E. I. Rashba and G. E. Gurgenishvili

A theoretical explanation is given for the anomalously high intensity of absorption-edge bands realted to defects.

<p>Numerous experiments* have shown that, in a number of semiconductors, the region of strong intrinsic absorption is preceded by a spectral region conatining a number of narrow and relatively weak absorption bands which we shall refer to as "prespectral" bands. According to Nikitine [2], prespectral bands with a complex fine structure are in fact observed in crystals in which strong absorption starts from exciton series with a strong n=1 band.</p>
