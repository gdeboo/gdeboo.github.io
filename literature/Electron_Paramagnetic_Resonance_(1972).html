<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Since its discovery by E. Zavoisky in 1944, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has grown to the point where it finds application in so many different branches of the physical and biological sciences. The question may therefore be raised as to whether EPR is now a technique, or tool like a voltmeter, or a subject. The argument for it being a technique appears very compelling when one considers its use in such disparate fields as that of local moments in metals on the one hand and the study of excited triplet states of biological molecules on the other. Yet, beside the very phenomenon of electron magnetic resonance itself which is being used to explore these different subjects, they all share a body of underlying physical topics such as crystal field theory, covalency effects, sources of linewidths, hyperfine structure, relaxation, etc., which often must be understood in a fair amount of detail to reach the most meaningful interpretation of results evein in very different fields.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1. General</h2>
<p>The principles involved in the generation of electron spin echoes and nuclear spin echoes are essentially the same. The differences between the two kinds of experiment are related to the technical proglems of scaling from the radiofrequency range to the microwave range, and to the physical circumstances which distinguish NMR and EPR studies.</p>
<p>The translation of spin echo methods into the microwave range leads to the use of pulsed magnetrons, klystrons, or traveling-wave tubes as signal sources, to the use of heterodyne or homodyne detection systems, etc. It also involves the choice of a shorter time scale for the pulsing sequences. In rf fields of comparable strength, electron moments are turned over by 90&deg; or 180&deg; in ~<math><msup><mi>10</mi><mi>-3</mi></msup></math> the time required for nuclear moments. Besides this, electron moments are more susceptible to time-dependent perturbations in the environment, and tend to be associated with shorter phase memory times. Scaling according to the ratio of magnetic moments, one might suppose that it would be necessary to go over to a nanosecond time scale in place of the microsecond time scale which is characteristic of nuclear spin-echo work. Fortunately, however, this is not essential under the experimental conditions which obtain in many EPR studies, and it is usually possible to compromise with an intermediate time scale in which the pulses are from 10 to 100 nsec in length.</p>
<p>A typical electron spin echo experiment involves liquid helium temperatures, and magnetically dilute materials. The reasons for this choice are essentially the same as in conventional CW (continuous wave) EPR. The spin-lattice relaxation rate <math><msub><mi>T</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> is often too rapid for any resonance to be obtained at room temperature, and spin-spin interactions are liable to obscure many of the finer details of resonance behavior in magnetically concentrated systems. It is, in fact, often more important in echo experiments than in CW experiments to choose the conditions so that spin-spin and spin-lattice interactions are relatively weak in order to minimize homogeneous line broadening. This does not rule out the possibility of obtaining electron spin echoes at room temperature, nor does it mean that echoes can never be found in crystals containing appreciable amounts of a paramagnetic impurity. <math><msub><mi>T</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> itself is quite long for certain centers,1 even at room temperature, and the effects of spin-spin interactions are sometimes reduced by narrowing mechanisms (see Section 3). The discussion which follows will, however, be primarily based on experiments which have been made at low temperatures and at spin concentrations &#x2A9D;<math><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>18</mn></msup></math>cm<math><msup><mi></mi><mn>-3</mn></msup></math>.</p>

<h3>3.5. Instantaneous Diffusion</h3>
<p>At this point, we interrupt this discussion of phase memory and of the form of the echo envelope to draw attention to an effect which is related to the pulsing conditions rather than to the intrinsic properties of the sample. This is the ''instantaneous diffusion'' mentioned by Klauder and Anderson.<sup>24,&ast;</sup>It results from the abrupt change in local fields caused by spin reorientation during pulse II and might perhaps be more appropriately classified with the mechanisms described in Section 6.4. We introduce it here, however, since it is primarily an experimental problem arising the study of envelope decay functions. It can, if overlooked, lead to a major error in the determination of the phase memory.</p>
